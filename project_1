#created by: D. Morris January 2019
#purpose: Stat counter for work purposes:
print('Welcome, this program will keep your stats handy. Lets get started >> :')
import time
time.sleep(3)

#get user input
print("Are you adding a new victim ('new') or a notification ('release')? >>:") 
victim= input('')
if victim == 'new':
  print('One new victim added to your stats! Keep up the good work! >> :')
else:
  print('One notification added to your stats! Great job! >> :')

##need to count the victims here i presume?

##add the counting and totals to the code below:

print("Are you finished? ('yes' or 'no'>> :")
finished = input('')
if finished == 'yes':
  print('Great work today! Here are your totals: >> :')
else:
  print('Okay! What else can I help calculate? >> :')
#This is where I need help calculating and putting the program back in to the loop again!
